There are three high level use cases:

1. **Record any configuration change**: this category is associated with compliance requirements where there is a need to 
keep track of any change in IT system configuration.

Two examples are:
- Track IT Systems Availability Status for comprehensive SLA recording.
- Track changes to IT System configuration for audit, security, non-repudiation, troubleshooting, forensics, etc.

2. **Report on configuration information & changes** for:
- SLA reporting
- Identification and correlation of issues
- Apportioning of resource usage

3. **Control systems by changing their configuration** for example:
- Becoming a central point of governance for Kubernetes resource allocation
- Controlling the behaviour of cloud native applications centrally
- Managing the lifecycle of cloud native application databases
